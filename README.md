# Bare HTML Skeleton

> This is a starting point for any very basic bare (no framework) web application. Online templaters always contain extra code, this provides a completely minimal starting point.

This repository contains 3 files (not including this README) that together form a basic bare website:
	* index.html
	* js/functions.js
	* css/style.css
The `index.html` page already contains references to `js/functions.js` and `css/style.css`.

The bootstrap references are already loaded into `index.html` from a CDN.

The layout of the index page is a standard layout made up of 3 rows, class names: `header`, `content` and `footer`.
